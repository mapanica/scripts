#from stop position search for nearest platform in this relation (not too far away)


1 .loop through stop_positions which are not in a stop_area relation, yet.
2. search for the closest platform in a route relation
3. make sure it's not too far away (start small and check)
4. define it's name (from stop_position or platform, store the other one and additional tags)
5. create new relation with both elements, correct roles and the tags
